# Brave-Portable-Updater
Works best with Python 3.12.
Most recent update I made it so python installs all dependencies. So all you need to is place the script in your brave portable dir install python 3.12 and run.
Python Script to download and extract the newest brave package to be run in the dir of https://github.com/portapps/brave-portable
