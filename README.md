# Brave-Portable-Updater
Script to download and extract the newest brave package to be run in the dir of https://github.com/portapps/brave-portable

⚠ If you want to run at boot edit the script to point towards the download_brave.ps1 ⚠

This is currently configured for Windows, as brave-portable is for Windows. Therefore I am now deprecating .py and .js
